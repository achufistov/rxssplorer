## Introduction
---------------

RXSSplorer collects reflected parameters potentially suitable for injection from various crawler tools and then tries to catch alert() from your proposed payload using qsreplace, airixss and kxss.

## Usage
-----

To use the Reflected XSS Scanner, simply run the `main.py` script:

```bash
python3 main.py -h                                   
usage: main.py [-h] [-u URL] [-uf URLS_FILE] [-p PAYLOAD] [-pf PAYLOADS_FILE] [-o {txt,html}] [-H HEADERS]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  -u URL, --url URL     URL to scan
  -uf URLS_FILE, --urls-file URLS_FILE
                        File containing URLs to scan
  -p PAYLOAD, --payload PAYLOAD
                        Payload to use
  -pf PAYLOADS_FILE, --payloads-file PAYLOADS_FILE
                        File containing payloads to use
  -o {txt,html}, --output {txt,html}
                        Output format (txt/html)
  -H HEADERS, --headers HEADERS
                        HTTP headers to pass to airixss (e.g., 'header1: value1,header2: value2')
```

## Example Use Cases

### Scanning a single URL using a single payload

To scan a single URL, use the following command:
```bash
python3 main.py -u http://testphp.vulnweb.com/ -p '<your payload>'
```

### Scanning Multiple URLs using multiple payloads

Do it this way:
```bash
python3 main.py -uf urls.txt -pf payloads.txt
```

### Selecting the file format with the scan results

So far, txt and html formats are available. Txt will be generated by default, so if you want to get the data in html format:
```bash
python3 main.py -uf urls.txt -pf payloads.txt -o html
```
You will receive the following message after the scan is completed:
```bash
The work is over. You can get acquainted with all vulnerable endpoints here: results.{txt or html depending on your choice}
```
